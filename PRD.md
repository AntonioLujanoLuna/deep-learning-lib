Below is a **Product Requirements Document (PRD)** for a C++-based, architecture-agnostic neural network library with an automatic differentiation (autograd) engine. This PRD outlines the project’s goals, scope, requirements, and success criteria, serving as a guide for planning, development, and collaboration.

# 1. Overview

## 1.1 Project Summary

The goal is to build a **C++ neural network library** that is **architecture-agnostic** (i.e., supports CPU, GPU, or other specialized hardware) and features an **automatic differentiation (autograd) engine**. This library should enable users to define neural network layers, compose them into models, run forward passes, and automatically compute gradients for training.

## 1.2 Why This Project?

- **Educational Value**: Implementing an autograd engine from scratch in C++ helps developers understand backpropagation, computational graphs, and memory management deeply.
- **Performance & Flexibility**: C++ can offer better control over performance-critical sections. Architecture abstraction allows extending the library to different compute backends (e.g., CPU, CUDA GPU, OpenCL).
- **Research & Prototyping**: A minimal, modular library is useful for low-level experimentation with novel layer types or hardware.

# 2. Goals & Non-Goals

## 2.1 Goals

1. **Automatic Differentiation**  
   - Implement a reverse-mode AD system (backprop) that builds and traverses a computational graph.  
   - Provide a straightforward API to perform forward passes and call `.backward()` for gradient calculations.

2. **Architecture Agnosticism**  
   - Abstract the underlying data storage/operations so that the same high-level code can run on different backends (CPU, GPU, etc.).

3. **Modular Neural Network Layers**  
   - Offer basic building blocks (e.g., Dense/Linear, Convolution, Activation functions) that can be composed to build models.

4. **Basic Optimization**  
   - Provide at least a simple optimizer (e.g., SGD).  
   - Support external integrations or user-implemented optimizers.

5. **Educational & Extensible**  
   - Codebase should be well-structured and documented, making it easy to extend with new layers, backends, or optimizers.

## 2.2 Non-Goals

1. **Full Production-Grade Framework**  
   - We are not replicating TensorFlow or PyTorch fully; we aim for an educational, minimal-but-extendable library.

2. **Extensive Model Zoo**  
   - We do not plan to ship numerous pretrained models (e.g., ResNet, BERT). We focus on the core engine and example layers.

3. **Advanced Graph Optimizations**  
   - While we want to keep the design open to future optimizations, advanced compiler-level transformations (e.g., operator fusion, graph rewriting) are out of scope for the initial version.

4. **Distributed Training**  
   - Multi-node or multi-GPU distributed training is a possible extension, but not a core requirement for this first release.

# 4. Product Features & Requirements

Below are the high-level functional and technical requirements:

## 4.1 Core Functional Requirements

1. **Tensor/Node Representation**  
   - A class or struct (e.g., `Tensor`) that contains:  
     - **Value**: the data (float arrays, matrices, etc.).  
     - **Grad**: gradient storage.  
     - **Parents**: references/pointers to parent tensors in the computation graph.  
     - **Backward Operation**: a callable that describes how to propagate gradients to parents.

2. **Computational Graph Construction**  
   - Building the graph implicitly during the forward pass via operator overloading or function calls (e.g., `add(Tensor A, Tensor B)`, `matmul(Tensor A, Tensor B)`, `relu(Tensor A)`, etc.).

3. **Backward Pass (Autodiff)**  
   - A mechanism to traverse the graph in reverse, calling the stored backward operations to accumulate gradients.  
   - Users can initiate backprop by calling something like `loss.backward()`.

4. **Basic Operations and Layers**  
   - **Elementwise Ops**: add, subtract, multiply, etc.  
   - **Matrix Multiply**: handle forward/backward for linear transformations.  
   - **Activations**: ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh.  
   - **Dense/Linear Layer**: `output = X * W + b`.  
   - **Basic Loss Functions**: e.g., MSE, Cross-Entropy.

5. **Parameter Management**  
   - Mark certain tensors (weights, biases) as trainable parameters.  
   - Provide a way to reset gradients and update them (e.g., with SGD).

6. **Simple Optimizer**  
   - **SGD**: `param -= lr * grad`.  
   - (Optional) Additional optimizer like **Adam** could be nice to have.

7. **CPU & GPU Abstraction**  
   - Define an interface or strategy for operations that can switch between CPU and GPU implementations.  
   - A minimal CPU backend is mandatory. GPU backend (CUDA/OpenCL) is a stretch goal.

## 4.2 Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance**  
   - The library should be reasonably optimized for CPU usage (possibly using BLAS or manual vectorization).  
   - The design should allow GPU acceleration without a complete rewrite of core logic.

2. **Modularity & Extensibility**  
   - Clear structure for adding new operations, layers, or backends.  
   - Well-organized code to encourage community contributions.

3. **Documentation & Examples**  
   - Provide clear, minimal tutorials on how to define a model, run forward/backward, and update parameters.

4. **Testing & Validation**  
   - Unit tests for core ops (checking forward correctness and comparing backward with numerical gradients).  
   - CI pipeline (if open-sourced) or basic scripts to automate tests.

5. **Maintainability**  
   - Use modern C++ features (C++11 or higher) for clarity (smart pointers, lambdas, etc.).  
   - Avoid or clearly document any heavy template metaprogramming that complicates maintenance.

# 5. Technical Approach

## 5.1 High-Level Architecture

1. **Tensor / Node Layer**  
   - Implements the data structure for values, gradients, references to parents, and a backward callback.

2. **Autodiff Engine**  
   - When a new tensor is created via an operation, we record the parents and the corresponding backward function.  
   - Calling `.backward()` triggers a graph traversal in reverse topological order.

3. **Layer Abstraction**  
   - Each layer (e.g., `Linear`, `Conv2D`) is a small class that contains its parameters (tensors) and a `.forward()` method returning a `Tensor`.

4. **Backend Abstraction**  
   - A design pattern (e.g., Strategy) to route operations to CPU or GPU code.  
   - E.g., an `ITensorBackend` interface with methods like `matmul(TensorData&, TensorData&)`, `add(TensorData&, TensorData&)`.  
   - Concrete implementations: `CPUTensorBackend`, `CUDATensorBackend`, etc.

5. **Optimizer**  
   - A class that, given a list of parameter tensors, updates them according to a rule (SGD, Adam, etc.).

## 5.2 Example Data Flow

1. **Forward**  
   - User calls:  
     ```cpp
     auto out = linear1.forward(x).relu();
     auto pred = linear2.forward(out);
     auto loss = mse(pred, y);
     ```  
   - Internally, each operation creates a `Tensor` with references to its parents and stores how to compute grads.

2. **Backward**  
   - User calls:  
     ```cpp
     loss.backward();
     ```  
   - Engine traverses the graph from `loss` backward, calling the stored lambdas (e.g., for matrix multiplication, elementwise ops) to accumulate gradients in parent nodes.

3. **Update**  
   - After gradients are computed, user calls optimizer’s update function:
     ```cpp
     sgd.update(linear1.params());
     sgd.update(linear2.params());
     ```

# 7. Risks & Mitigations

1. **Complexity of C++**  
   - **Risk**: Memory management and templates could complicate implementation.  
   - **Mitigation**: Use modern C++ features (smart pointers, simple APIs) and limit template metaprogramming.

2. **Time Constraints**  
   - **Risk**: Implementing a GPU backend can be time-intensive.  
   - **Mitigation**: Start with CPU only, keep GPU as a future extension.

3. **Performance Pitfalls**  
   - **Risk**: Naive implementations of matrix operations might be slow.  
   - **Mitigation**: Integrate BLAS libraries for CPU. For GPU, start with basic kernels, then optimize if time allows.

4. **Validation**  
   - **Risk**: Incorrect gradient implementations.  
   - **Mitigation**: Compare with numerical gradients (finite differences) for each operation.
